# Permission Management in Linux

## Objective


The primary objective of the Permission Management in Linux project is to understand, implement, and manage file and directory permissions in a Linux environment. This includes gaining proficiency in using command-line tools to assign, modify, and audit user and group access rights, ensuring system security and integrity. The project aims to provide hands-on experience with Linux permission models such as standard (read, write, execute) and advanced permissions (setuid, setgid, sticky bit), while emphasizing best practices for securing sensitive data and maintaining system stability in multi-user environments.
